234. Palindrome Linked List
Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a
palindrome
 or false otherwise.



Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 9


Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
